Currently, over 50% of staff have tried AI tools but struggle to get useful results due to lack of knowledge about prompting, context-setting, and appropriate use cases. This optional training program will provide practical, role-specific guidance to help staff save time on routine tasks and produce higher-quality outputs.\n\nWho else is involved?\n    Information Systems (Jak)\n     Human Resources (Head of Training and Development),\n    Stakeholder groups include all APS staff as potential learners, department heads who will champion adoption, and IT/HR for ongoing support.\n\nWhat goals/projects does this relate to?\n    APS Strategic Goal: Enhance Operational Efficiency\n    IS Department Goal: Leverage AI and Automation to Enhance Business Processes and Drive Innovation\n\nWhat are the specific outcomes that will result from this piece of work?\n    Modular AI training program developed with 'x' modules (fundamentals, prompt engineering, role-specific applications, advanced features, best practices, etc)\n    Pre-training survey deployed to assess staff needs and skill levels\n    Curated resource library established with free, high-quality external content\n    Slack community (#ai-learning-community) launched for peer support\n    Measurable improvement in AI tool adoption and effectiveness\n\nWhat is the definition of done?\n    All training modules developed and accessible via...

Passkey is expected to improve user experience and streamline reporting by standardizing hotel reservation data across events.\n\nCurrent UAT is partially blocked pending vendor clarification on key functionality. Once clarified, testing will resume to confirm that booking flows, custom writeback, and data capture (e.g., name, email, affiliation, Nimble ID) are functioning as expected.\n\nWhy we’re doing this:\nThis UAT ensures we can deliver a consistent and user-friendly housing reservation experience for Division and Topical Group Meetings, support reporting on housing pickup, and enable presenter-to-housing tracking.\n\nNext Step Toward Done:\nFollow up with the vendor to clarify the blocking issue and resume end-to-end scenario testing once resolved.\n\nDefinition of Done:\nAll planned UAT scenarios pass, no outstanding vendor issues remain, and the integration is approved for production deployment.",

We can send the 1-3 digit letter code in addition or instead of the title if preferred.\n    Add an “original submission date.” – a new feature in Duplicate submissions.\n    Revision information — This could be tricky and possibly not worth the additional effort. We need more info on the cost/benefit of this feature.\n    Break the author's name into parts (first/last/etc.)\n    Add author email\n\nNote: Items 5 & 6 could be completed and deployed within an hour and can probably be done (by me) right away without having to go through budget & prioritization.\n\n\nSource Files\n\n\n\n> Yes, PDF source, or probably PDF generated by you, is fine! Example not needed. The challenge is to make those PDF files available securely, like:\n \n    Create a signed download link for each file, typically with a (short) Time-To-Live (TTL). Cloud services like Google and AWS (S3) can do this easily.\n    Add those signed download links to the JSON push messsage.\n    The APS connector system at the side of STM Integrity Hub, receives the push message, takes the links.\n    Then downloads the files from the signed download link --- this is typically seconds, so that TTL can be low like 5 minutes or so.\n\n\n\nThe full email chain is attached for reference.\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n    For journal ids we should use the same codes we use for production vendors. I.e. Journal#vendor_code\n    Author name parts and email definition is easy.\n    \n\nQuestions:\n\n    Pretty sure the received date in the existing export is the original date.",

Looker is expensive, slow, and limits APS’s ability to make timely, data-informed decisions. Tableau provides a more scalable and intuitive platform, but it requires a rethinking of how APS models and delivers data.\n \n Who else is involved? \n    Information Systems, Brilliant Associates (vendor), dashboard owners (Membership, OEA, Publications, Programs), and the Data Platforms team. \n    Stakeholder groups include data consumers, dashboard creators, and power users. \n    The Enterprise Architect is engaged to help align this work with future data warehouse and CDP plans.\n \n What goals/projects does this relate to? \n    APS Strategic Goal: Strengthen Data-Driven Decision Making\n    IS Department Goal: Modernize Business Intelligence Capabilities\n    Related Initiatives: Customer Data Platform (CDP), data warehouse planning, semantic layer design\n \n What are the specific outcomes that will result from this piece of work? \n    Core dashboards migrated or redesigned to answer key business questions\n    Staff trained in Tableau;\n \n What is the definition of done? \n    Tableau dashboards live and validated by users\n    Documentation, training, and support available and in use\n \n What is the next step towards done? \n    Develop data sources, migrate core dashboards (Membership, OEA, Pubs, 360s) - done\n    Validate visualizations, connections, transformations - in progress",
